# Maggi Reviews
 This project is about text analysis of customer reviews of Maggi noodles on Amazon.in.

<b>What do people talk about when they talk about Maggi noodles?</b>

<i>Data collection</i>: I gathered a sample of 4500 reviews from Amazon.in on two Maggi noodles products (different packaging). The data include reviews from 2017 to 2020. 

<i>Sentiment classification</i>:  The star ratings above 3 were labelled as positive, and below 3 as negative and =3 as neutral. 

<b><i>Analysis</i></b> 

Maggi is a very loved product in India and sentiment of reviews reflect that. Several users mentioned the word ‘good’, and ‘best’ in their reviews, both having highest frequencies in the dataset. In the plot, percentage of reviews under each sentiment is plotted against days to understand the trend of each sentiment category. In 979 days covered for this analysis, a majority of the revies have shown a positive sentiment. But, share of negative reviews has also escalated since January 2020 as shown by the red regression line. While, positive reviews signal validation for the product, negative reviews are an opportunity for improvement. 
 
On further analysis, negative reviews since January 2020 mentioned words like “broken”, “crushed”, and “damaged”, which understandably are describing the packaging. This sort of analysis could help a company identify the problems and an opportunity to fix them. In this case, problem lies in the downstream process. Maggi could speak to its packaging vendors and make its packets sturdier, so the noodles remain intact during transportation. Some reviewers also complained about finding “ants” in their Maggi packets. This is a serious problem, one for which they can be sued. 
 
<b><i>Negative reviews versus positive reviews</b></i> 

Relative frequency analysis was used to identify the differentiating words in the negative and the positive reviews. In the positive reviews, words like “yummy”, “excellent” and “taste” point to the taste of the product, which users have appreciated. A product manager could use these words in designing their brand strategy or use it to introduce new flavors (which Maggi already has).
