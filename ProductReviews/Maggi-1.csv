  Maggi is called national food of India, lol. It's tasty and non sticky and can be prepared easily and quickly. So feeling hungry? It's maggi time now.Packaging and delivery was good and prompt. The noodles were recently made so it was a fresh product. Recommend to every age group as a quick snack.

  Review of maggi:Who am I to review Maggi. It's iconic for anyone born in the 80s and 90s.Review of this pack:1) better than large packs that you have to store in the open2) Lasts longer than regular pack of eight, again because its closed.Disadvantage :More plastic usage than regular pack or tenConclusion:If you are going to consume Maggi over longer period of time but this one, if you will finish pack of ten within a week buy the regular large packs as it saves plastic pollution--

  I just love the 2 minute noodle !Pros-1. Broken during delivery or not, doesnt really matter to me, since I prefer to break them into 2 pieces anyways before I cook them2. This family big pack really is cost effective.3. Nestle maggi has been around for so many decades from my childhood and they have been consistent and have even braved the recent questions raised on the quality of their product!4. Masala taste is ever so tasty5. Cooks really fast...ok not 2, let's say 5mins!Cons-1. Though maggi comes with atta noodles (healthier) than this maggi, the atta maggi is quiet expensive than this normal maggi. How I wish the oats and atta maggi would have been cheaper too

Nestle maggi has been around for so many decades from my childhood and they have been consistent and have even braved the recent questions raised on the quality of their product!4. Masala taste is ever so tasty5. Cooks really fast...ok not 2, let's say 5mins!Cons-1. Though maggi comes with atta noodles (healthier) than this maggi, the atta maggi is quiet expensive than this normal maggi. How I wish the oats and atta maggi would have been cheaper too

  Maggi is called national food of India, lol. It's tasty and non sticky and can be prepared easily and quickly. So feeling hungry? It's maggi time now.Packaging and delivery was good and prompt.

  Review of maggi:Who am I to review Maggi. It's iconic for anyone born in the 80s and 90s.Review of this pack:1) better than large packs that you have to store in the open2) Lasts longer than regular pack of eight, again because its closed.Disadvantage :More plastic usage than regular pack or tenConclusion:If you are going to consume Maggi over longer period of time but this one, if you will finish pack of ten within a week buy the regular large packs as it saves plastic pollution--

The noodles were recently made so it was a fresh product. Recommend to every age group as a quick snack.

  Review of maggi:Who am I to review Maggi. It's iconic for anyone born in the 80s and 90s.Review of this pack:1) better than large packs that you have to store in the open2) Lasts longer than regular pack of eight, again because its closed.Disadvantage :More plastic usage than regular pack or tenConclusion:If you are going to consume Maggi over longer period of time but this one, if you will finish pack of ten within a week buy the regular large packs as it saves plastic pollution--

  I just love the 2 minute noodle !Pros-1. Broken during delivery or not, doesnt really matter to me, since I prefer to break them into 2 pieces anyways before I cook them2. This family big pack really is cost effective.3. Nestle maggi has been around for so many decades from my childhood and they have been consistent and have even braved the recent questions raised on the quality of their product!4. Masala taste is ever so tasty5. Cooks really fast...ok not 2, let's say 5mins!Cons-1. Though maggi comes with atta noodles (healthier) than this maggi, the atta maggi is quiet expensive than this normal maggi. How I wish the oats and atta maggi would have been cheaper too

  Maggi is called national food of India, lol. It's tasty and non sticky and can be prepared easily and quickly. So feeling hungry? It's maggi time now.Packaging and delivery was good and prompt. The noodles were recently made so it was a fresh product. Recommend to every age group as a quick snack.

  Review of maggi:Who am I to review Maggi. It's iconic for anyone born in the 80s and 90s.Review of this pack:1) better than large packs that you have to store in the open2) Lasts longer than regular pack of eight, again because its closed.Disadvantage :More plastic usage than regular pack or tenConclusion:If you are going to consume Maggi over longer period of time but this one, if you will finish pack of ten within a week buy the regular large packs as it saves plastic pollution--

  I just love the 2 minute noodle !Pros-1. Broken during delivery or not, doesnt really matter to me, since I prefer to break them into 2 pieces anyways before I cook them2. This family big pack really is cost effective.3. Nestle maggi has been around for so many decades from my childhood and they have been consistent and have even braved the recent questions raised on the quality of their product!4. Masala taste is ever so tasty5. Cooks really fast...ok not 2, let's say 5mins!Cons-1. Though maggi comes with atta noodles (healthier) than this maggi, the atta maggi is quiet expensive than this normal maggi. How I wish the oats and atta maggi would have been cheaper too

  I just love the 2 minute noodle !Pros-1. Broken during delivery or not, doesnt really matter to me, since I prefer to break them into 2 pieces anyways before I cook them2. This family big pack really is cost effective.3. Nestle maggi has been around for so many decades from my childhood and they have been consistent and have even braved the recent questions raised on the quality of their product!4. Masala taste is ever so tasty5. Cooks really fast...ok not 2, let's say 5mins!Cons-1. Though maggi comes with atta noodles (healthier) than this maggi, the atta maggi is quiet expensive than this normal maggi. How I wish the oats and atta maggi would have been cheaper too

  Maggi is called national food of India, lol. It's tasty and non sticky and can be prepared easily and quickly. So feeling hungry? It's maggi time now.Packaging and delivery was good and prompt. The noodles were recently made so it was a fresh product. Recommend to every age group as a quick snack.

  Review of maggi:Who am I to review Maggi. It's iconic for anyone born in the 80s and 90s.Review of this pack:1) better than large packs that you have to store in the open2) Lasts longer than regular pack of eight, again because its closed.Disadvantage :More plastic usage than regular pack or tenConclusion:If you are going to consume Maggi over longer period of time but this one, if you will finish pack of ten within a week buy the regular large packs as it saves plastic pollution--

  Maggi is called national food of India, lol. It's tasty and non sticky and can be prepared easily and quickly. So feeling hungry? It's maggi time now.Packaging and delivery was good and prompt. The noodles were recently made so it was a fresh product. Recommend to every age group as a quick snack.

  Review of maggi:Who am I to review Maggi. It's iconic for anyone born in the 80s and 90s.Review of this pack:1) better than large packs that you have to store in the open2) Lasts longer than regular pack of eight, again because its closed.Disadvantage :More plastic usage than regular pack or tenConclusion:If you are going to consume Maggi over longer period of time but this one, if you will finish pack of ten within a week buy the regular large packs as it saves plastic pollution--

  I just love the 2 minute noodle !Pros-1. Broken during delivery or not, doesnt really matter to me, since I prefer to break them into 2 pieces anyways before I cook them2. This family big pack really is cost effective.3. Nestle maggi has been around for so many decades from my childhood and they have been consistent and have even braved the recent questions raised on the quality of their product!4. Masala taste is ever so tasty5. Cooks really fast...ok not 2, let's say 5mins!Cons-1. Though maggi comes with atta noodles (healthier) than this maggi, the atta maggi is quiet expensive than this normal maggi. How I wish the oats and atta maggi would have been cheaper too

  Maggi is called national food of India, lol. It's tasty and non sticky and can be prepared easily and quickly. So feeling hungry? It's maggi time now.Packaging and delivery was good and prompt. The noodles were recently made so it was a fresh product. Recommend to every age group as a quick snack.

  Review of maggi:Who am I to review Maggi. It's iconic for anyone born in the 80s and 90s.Review of this pack:1) better than large packs that you have to store in the open2) Lasts longer than regular pack of eight, again because its closed.Disadvantage :More plastic usage than regular pack or tenConclusion:If you are going to consume Maggi over longer period of time but this one, if you will finish pack of ten within a week buy the regular large packs as it saves plastic pollution--

  I just love the 2 minute noodle !Pros-1. Broken during delivery or not, doesnt really matter to me, since I prefer to break them into 2 pieces anyways before I cook them2. This family big pack really is cost effective.3. Nestle maggi has been around for so many decades from my childhood and they have been consistent and have even braved the recent questions raised on the quality of their product!4. Masala taste is ever so tasty5. Cooks really fast...ok not 2, let's say 5mins!Cons-1. Though maggi comes with atta noodles (healthier) than this maggi, the atta maggi is quiet expensive than this normal maggi. How I wish the oats and atta maggi would have been cheaper too

This family big pack really is cost effective.3. Nestle maggi has been around for so many decades from my childhood and they have been consistent and have even braved the recent questions raised on the quality of their product!4. Masala taste is ever so tasty5. Cooks really fast...ok not 2, let's say 5mins!Cons-1. Though maggi comes with atta noodles (healthier) than this maggi, the atta maggi is quiet expensive than this normal maggi. How I wish the oats and atta maggi would have been cheaper too

  Maggi is called national food of India, lol. It's tasty and non sticky and can be prepared easily and quickly. So feeling hungry? It's maggi time now.Packaging and delivery was good and prompt.

  Review of maggi:Who am I to review Maggi. It's iconic for anyone born in the 80s and 90s.Review of this pack:1) better than large packs that you have to store in the open2) Lasts longer than regular pack of eight, again because its closed.Disadvantage :More plastic usage than regular pack or tenConclusion:If you are going to consume Maggi over longer period of time but this one, if you will finish pack of ten within a week buy the regular large packs as it saves plastic pollution--

  Maggi is called national food of India, lol. It's tasty and non sticky and can be prepared easily and quickly. So feeling hungry? It's maggi time now.Packaging and delivery was good and prompt. The noodles were recently made so it was a fresh product. Recommend to every age group as a quick snack.

  Review of maggi:Who am I to review Maggi. It's iconic for anyone born in the 80s and 90s.Review of this pack:1) better than large packs that you have to store in the open2) Lasts longer than regular pack of eight, again because its closed.Disadvantage :More plastic usage than regular pack or tenConclusion:If you are going to consume Maggi over longer period of time but this one, if you will finish pack of ten within a week buy the regular large packs as it saves plastic pollution--

  I just love the 2 minute noodle !Pros-1. Broken during delivery or not, doesnt really matter to me, since I prefer to break them into 2 pieces anyways before I cook them2. This family big pack really is cost effective.3. Nestle maggi has been around for so many decades from my childhood and they have been consistent and have even braved the recent questions raised on the quality of their product!4. Masala taste is ever so tasty5. Cooks really fast...ok not 2, let's say 5mins!Cons-1. Though maggi comes with atta noodles (healthier) than this maggi, the atta maggi is quiet expensive than this normal maggi. How I wish the oats and atta maggi would have been cheaper too

  Maggi is called national food of India, lol. It's tasty and non sticky and can be prepared easily and quickly. So feeling hungry? It's maggi time now.Packaging and delivery was good and prompt. The noodles were recently made so it was a fresh product. Recommend to every age group as a quick snack.

  Review of maggi:Who am I to review Maggi. It's iconic for anyone born in the 80s and 90s.Review of this pack:1) better than large packs that you have to store in the open2) Lasts longer than regular pack of eight, again because its closed.Disadvantage :More plastic usage than regular pack or tenConclusion:If you are going to consume Maggi over longer period of time but this one, if you will finish pack of ten within a week buy the regular large packs as it saves plastic pollution--

  I just love the 2 minute noodle !Pros-1. Broken during delivery or not, doesnt really matter to me, since I prefer to break them into 2 pieces anyways before I cook them2. This family big pack really is cost effective.3. Nestle maggi has been around for so many decades from my childhood and they have been consistent and have even braved the recent questions raised on the quality of their product!4. Masala taste is ever so tasty5. Cooks really fast...ok not 2, let's say 5mins!Cons-1. Though maggi comes with atta noodles (healthier) than this maggi, the atta maggi is quiet expensive than this normal maggi. How I wish the oats and atta maggi would have been cheaper too

It's iconic for anyone born in the 80s and 90s.Review of this pack:1) better than large packs that you have to store in the open2) Lasts longer than regular pack of eight, again because its closed.Disadvantage :More plastic usage than regular pack or tenConclusion:If you are going to consume Maggi over longer period of time but this one, if you will finish pack of ten within a week buy the regular large packs as it saves plastic pollution--

  I just love the 2 minute noodle !Pros-1. Broken during delivery or not, doesnt really matter to me, since I prefer to break them into 2 pieces anyways before I cook them2. This family big pack really is cost effective.3. Nestle maggi has been around for so many decades from my childhood and they have been consistent and have even braved the recent questions raised on the quality of their product!4. Masala taste is ever so tasty5. Cooks really fast...ok not 2, let's say 5mins!Cons-1. Though maggi comes with atta noodles (healthier) than this maggi, the atta maggi is quiet expensive than this normal maggi. How I wish the oats and atta maggi would have been cheaper too

  Maggi is called national food of India, lol. It's tasty and non sticky and can be prepared easily and quickly. So feeling hungry? It's maggi time now.Packaging and delivery was good and prompt. The noodles were recently made so it was a fresh product. Recommend to every age group as a quick snack.

  Maggi is called national food of India, lol. It's tasty and non sticky and can be prepared easily and quickly. So feeling hungry? It's maggi time now.Packaging and delivery was good and prompt. The noodles were recently made so it was a fresh product. Recommend to every age group as a quick snack.

  Review of maggi:Who am I to review Maggi. It's iconic for anyone born in the 80s and 90s.Review of this pack:1) better than large packs that you have to store in the open2) Lasts longer than regular pack of eight, again because its closed.Disadvantage :More plastic usage than regular pack or tenConclusion:If you are going to consume Maggi over longer period of time but this one, if you will finish pack of ten within a week buy the regular large packs as it saves plastic pollution--

  I just love the 2 minute noodle !Pros-1. Broken during delivery or not, doesnt really matter to me, since I prefer to break them into 2 pieces anyways before I cook them2. This family big pack really is cost effective.3. Nestle maggi has been around for so many decades from my childhood and they have been consistent and have even braved the recent questions raised on the quality of their product!4. Masala taste is ever so tasty5. Cooks really fast...ok not 2, let's say 5mins!Cons-1. Though maggi comes with atta noodles (healthier) than this maggi, the atta maggi is quiet expensive than this normal maggi. How I wish the oats and atta maggi would have been cheaper too

  Maggi is called national food of India, lol. It's tasty and non sticky and can be prepared easily and quickly. So feeling hungry? It's maggi time now.Packaging and delivery was good and prompt. The noodles were recently made so it was a fresh product. Recommend to every age group as a quick snack.

  Review of maggi:Who am I to review Maggi. It's iconic for anyone born in the 80s and 90s.Review of this pack:1) better than large packs that you have to store in the open2) Lasts longer than regular pack of eight, again because its closed.Disadvantage :More plastic usage than regular pack or tenConclusion:If you are going to consume Maggi over longer period of time but this one, if you will finish pack of ten within a week buy the regular large packs as it saves plastic pollution--

  I just love the 2 minute noodle !Pros-1. Broken during delivery or not, doesnt really matter to me, since I prefer to break them into 2 pieces anyways before I cook them2. This family big pack really is cost effective.3. Nestle maggi has been around for so many decades from my childhood and they have been consistent and have even braved the recent questions raised on the quality of their product!4. Masala taste is ever so tasty5. Cooks really fast...ok not 2, let's say 5mins!Cons-1. Though maggi comes with atta noodles (healthier) than this maggi, the atta maggi is quiet expensive than this normal maggi. How I wish the oats and atta maggi would have been cheaper too

  I just love the 2 minute noodle !Pros-1. Broken during delivery or not, doesnt really matter to me, since I prefer to break them into 2 pieces anyways before I cook them2. This family big pack really is cost effective.3. Nestle maggi has been around for so many decades from my childhood and they have been consistent and have even braved the recent questions raised on the quality of their product!4. Masala taste is ever so tasty5. Cooks really fast...ok not 2, let's say 5mins!Cons-1. Though maggi comes with atta noodles (healthier) than this maggi, the atta maggi is quiet expensive than this normal maggi. How I wish the oats and atta maggi would have been cheaper too

  Maggi is called national food of India, lol. It's tasty and non sticky and can be prepared easily and quickly. So feeling hungry? It's maggi time now.Packaging and delivery was good and prompt. The noodles were recently made so it was a fresh product. Recommend to every age group as a quick snack.

  Review of maggi:Who am I to review Maggi. It's iconic for anyone born in the 80s and 90s.Review of this pack:1) better than large packs that you have to store in the open2) Lasts longer than regular pack of eight, again because its closed.Disadvantage :More plastic usage than regular pack or tenConclusion:If you are going to consume Maggi over longer period of time but this one, if you will finish pack of ten within a week buy the regular large packs as it saves plastic pollution--

  Maggi is called national food of India, lol. It's tasty and non sticky and can be prepared easily and quickly. So feeling hungry? It's maggi time now.Packaging and delivery was good and prompt. The noodles were recently made so it was a fresh product. Recommend to every age group as a quick snack.

  Review of maggi:Who am I to review Maggi. It's iconic for anyone born in the 80s and 90s.Review of this pack:1) better than large packs that you have to store in the open2) Lasts longer than regular pack of eight, again because its closed.Disadvantage :More plastic usage than regular pack or tenConclusion:If you are going to consume Maggi over longer period of time but this one, if you will finish pack of ten within a week buy the regular large packs as it saves plastic pollution--

  I just love the 2 minute noodle !Pros-1. Broken during delivery or not, doesnt really matter to me, since I prefer to break them into 2 pieces anyways before I cook them2. This family big pack really is cost effective.3. Nestle maggi has been around for so many decades from my childhood and they have been consistent and have even braved the recent questions raised on the quality of their product!4. Masala taste is ever so tasty5. Cooks really fast...ok not 2, let's say 5mins!Cons-1. Though maggi comes with atta noodles (healthier) than this maggi, the atta maggi is quiet expensive than this normal maggi. How I wish the oats and atta maggi would have been cheaper too

Though maggi comes with atta noodles (healthier) than this maggi, the atta maggi is quiet expensive than this normal maggi. How I wish the oats and atta maggi would have been cheaper too

  Maggi is called national food of India, lol. It's tasty and non sticky and can be prepared easily and quickly. So feeling hungry? It's maggi time now.Packaging and delivery was good and prompt. The noodles were recently made so it was a fresh product. Recommend to every age group as a quick snack.

  Review of maggi:Who am I to review Maggi. It's iconic for anyone born in the 80s and 90s.Review of this pack:1) better than large packs that you have to store in the open2) Lasts longer than regular pack of eight, again because its closed.Disadvantage :More plastic usage than regular pack or tenConclusion:If you are going to consume Maggi over longer period of time but this one, if you will finish pack of ten within a week buy the regular large packs as it saves plastic pollution--

  Review of maggi:Who am I to review Maggi. It's iconic for anyone born in the 80s and 90s.Review of this pack:1) better than large packs that you have to store in the open2) Lasts longer than regular pack of eight, again because its closed.Disadvantage :More plastic usage than regular pack or tenConclusion:If you are going to consume Maggi over longer period of time but this one, if you will finish pack of ten within a week buy the regular large packs as it saves plastic pollution--

  I just love the 2 minute noodle !Pros-1. Broken during delivery or not, doesnt really matter to me, since I prefer to break them into 2 pieces anyways before I cook them2. This family big pack really is cost effective.3. Nestle maggi has been around for so many decades from my childhood and they have been consistent and have even braved the recent questions raised on the quality of their product!4. Masala taste is ever so tasty5. Cooks really fast...ok not 2, let's say 5mins!Cons-1. Though maggi comes with atta noodles (healthier) than this maggi, the atta maggi is quiet expensive than this normal maggi. How I wish the oats and atta maggi would have been cheaper too

  Maggi is called national food of India, lol. It's tasty and non sticky and can be prepared easily and quickly. So feeling hungry? It's maggi time now.Packaging and delivery was good and prompt. The noodles were recently made so it was a fresh product. Recommend to every age group as a quick snack.

  Review of maggi:Who am I to review Maggi. It's iconic for anyone born in the 80s and 90s.Review of this pack:1) better than large packs that you have to store in the open2) Lasts longer than regular pack of eight, again because its closed.Disadvantage :More plastic usage than regular pack or tenConclusion:If you are going to consume Maggi over longer period of time but this one, if you will finish pack of ten within a week buy the regular large packs as it saves plastic pollution--

  I just love the 2 minute noodle !Pros-1. Broken during delivery or not, doesnt really matter to me, since I prefer to break them into 2 pieces anyways before I cook them2. This family big pack really is cost effective.3. Nestle maggi has been around for so many decades from my childhood and they have been consistent and have even braved the recent questions raised on the quality of their product!4. Masala taste is ever so tasty5. Cooks really fast...ok not 2, let's say 5mins!Cons-1. Though maggi comes with atta noodles (healthier) than this maggi, the atta maggi is quiet expensive than this normal maggi. How I wish the oats and atta maggi would have been cheaper too

  Maggi is called national food of India, lol. It's tasty and non sticky and can be prepared easily and quickly. So feeling hungry? It's maggi time now.Packaging and delivery was good and prompt. The noodles were recently made so it was a fresh product. Recommend to every age group as a quick snack.

  Review of maggi:Who am I to review Maggi. It's iconic for anyone born in the 80s and 90s.Review of this pack:1) better than large packs that you have to store in the open2) Lasts longer than regular pack of eight, again because its closed.Disadvantage :More plastic usage than regular pack or tenConclusion:If you are going to consume Maggi over longer period of time but this one, if you will finish pack of ten within a week buy the regular large packs as it saves plastic pollution--

  I just love the 2 minute noodle !Pros-1. Broken during delivery or not, doesnt really matter to me, since I prefer to break them into 2 pieces anyways before I cook them2. This family big pack really is cost effective.3. Nestle maggi has been around for so many decades from my childhood and they have been consistent and have even braved the recent questions raised on the quality of their product!4. Masala taste is ever so tasty5. Cooks really fast...ok not 2, let's say 5mins!Cons-1. Though maggi comes with atta noodles (healthier) than this maggi, the atta maggi is quiet expensive than this normal maggi. How I wish the oats and atta maggi would have been cheaper too

  I just love the 2 minute noodle !Pros-1. Broken during delivery or not, doesnt really matter to me, since I prefer to break them into 2 pieces anyways before I cook them2. This family big pack really is cost effective.3. Nestle maggi has been around for so many decades from my childhood and they have been consistent and have even braved the recent questions raised on the quality of their product!4. Masala taste is ever so tasty5. Cooks really fast...ok not 2, let's say 5mins!Cons-1. Though maggi comes with atta noodles (healthier) than this maggi, the atta maggi is quiet expensive than this normal maggi. How I wish the oats and atta maggi would have been cheaper too

  Review of maggi:Who am I to review Maggi. It's iconic for anyone born in the 80s and 90s.Review of this pack:1) better than large packs that you have to store in the open2) Lasts longer than regular pack of eight, again because its closed.Disadvantage :More plastic usage than regular pack or tenConclusion:If you are going to consume Maggi over longer period of time but this one, if you will finish pack of ten within a week buy the regular large packs as it saves plastic pollution--

  Maggi is called national food of India, lol. It's tasty and non sticky and can be prepared easily and quickly. So feeling hungry? It's maggi time now.Packaging and delivery was good and prompt. The noodles were recently made so it was a fresh product. Recommend to every age group as a quick snack.

  Review of maggi:Who am I to review Maggi. It's iconic for anyone born in the 80s and 90s.Review of this pack:1) better than large packs that you have to store in the open2) Lasts longer than regular pack of eight, again because its closed.Disadvantage :More plastic usage than regular pack or tenConclusion:If you are going to consume Maggi over longer period of time but this one, if you will finish pack of ten within a week buy the regular large packs as it saves plastic pollution--

  I just love the 2 minute noodle !Pros-1. Broken during delivery or not, doesnt really matter to me, since I prefer to break them into 2 pieces anyways before I cook them2. This family big pack really is cost effective.3. Nestle maggi has been around for so many decades from my childhood and they have been consistent and have even braved the recent questions raised on the quality of their product!4. Masala taste is ever so tasty5. Cooks really fast...ok not 2, let's say 5mins!Cons-1. Though maggi comes with atta noodles (healthier) than this maggi, the atta maggi is quiet expensive than this normal maggi. How I wish the oats and atta maggi would have been cheaper too

  Maggi is called national food of India, lol. It's tasty and non sticky and can be prepared easily and quickly. So feeling hungry? It's maggi time now.Packaging and delivery was good and prompt. The noodles were recently made so it was a fresh product. Recommend to every age group as a quick snack.

  Review of maggi:Who am I to review Maggi. It's iconic for anyone born in the 80s and 90s.Review of this pack:1) better than large packs that you have to store in the open2) Lasts longer than regular pack of eight, again because its closed.Disadvantage :More plastic usage than regular pack or tenConclusion:If you are going to consume Maggi over longer period of time but this one, if you will finish pack of ten within a week buy the regular large packs as it saves plastic pollution--

  I just love the 2 minute noodle !Pros-1. Broken during delivery or not, doesnt really matter to me, since I prefer to break them into 2 pieces anyways before I cook them2. This family big pack really is cost effective.3. Nestle maggi has been around for so many decades from my childhood and they have been consistent and have even braved the recent questions raised on the quality of their product!4. Masala taste is ever so tasty5. Cooks really fast...ok not 2, let's say 5mins!Cons-1. Though maggi comes with atta noodles (healthier) than this maggi, the atta maggi is quiet expensive than this normal maggi. How I wish the oats and atta maggi would have been cheaper too

It's iconic for anyone born in the 80s and 90s.Review of this pack:1) better than large packs that you have to store in the open2) Lasts longer than regular pack of eight, again because its closed.Disadvantage :More plastic usage than regular pack or tenConclusion:If you are going to consume Maggi over longer period of time but this one, if you will finish pack of ten within a week buy the regular large packs as it saves plastic pollution--

  I just love the 2 minute noodle !Pros-1. Broken during delivery or not, doesnt really matter to me, since I prefer to break them into 2 pieces anyways before I cook them2. This family big pack really is cost effective.3. Nestle maggi has been around for so many decades from my childhood and they have been consistent and have even braved the recent questions raised on the quality of their product!4. Masala taste is ever so tasty5. Cooks really fast...ok not 2, let's say 5mins!Cons-1. Though maggi comes with atta noodles (healthier) than this maggi, the atta maggi is quiet expensive than this normal maggi. How I wish the oats and atta maggi would have been cheaper too

  Maggi is called national food of India, lol. It's tasty and non sticky and can be prepared easily and quickly. So feeling hungry? It's maggi time now.Packaging and delivery was good and prompt. The noodles were recently made so it was a fresh product. Recommend to every age group as a quick snack.

  Review of maggi:Who am I to review Maggi. It's iconic for anyone born in the 80s and 90s.Review of this pack:1) better than large packs that you have to store in the open2) Lasts longer than regular pack of eight, again because its closed.Disadvantage :More plastic usage than regular pack or tenConclusion:If you are going to consume Maggi over longer period of time but this one, if you will finish pack of ten within a week buy the regular large packs as it saves plastic pollution--

  I just love the 2 minute noodle !Pros-1. Broken during delivery or not, doesnt really matter to me, since I prefer to break them into 2 pieces anyways before I cook them2. This family big pack really is cost effective.3. Nestle maggi has been around for so many decades from my childhood and they have been consistent and have even braved the recent questions raised on the quality of their product!4. Masala taste is ever so tasty5. Cooks really fast...ok not 2, let's say 5mins!Cons-1. Though maggi comes with atta noodles (healthier) than this maggi, the atta maggi is quiet expensive than this normal maggi. How I wish the oats and atta maggi would have been cheaper too

Nestle maggi has been around for so many decades from my childhood and they have been consistent and have even braved the recent questions raised on the quality of their product!4. Masala taste is ever so tasty5. Cooks really fast...ok not 2, let's say 5mins!Cons-1. Though maggi comes with atta noodles (healthier) than this maggi, the atta maggi is quiet expensive than this normal maggi. How I wish the oats and atta maggi would have been cheaper too

  Review of maggi:Who am I to review Maggi. It's iconic for anyone born in the 80s and 90s.Review of this pack:1) better than large packs that you have to store in the open2) Lasts longer than regular pack of eight, again because its closed.Disadvantage :More plastic usage than regular pack or tenConclusion:If you are going to consume Maggi over longer period of time but this one, if you will finish pack of ten within a week buy the regular large packs as it saves plastic pollution--

The noodles were recently made so it was a fresh product. Recommend to every age group as a quick snack.

  Review of maggi:Who am I to review Maggi. It's iconic for anyone born in the 80s and 90s.Review of this pack:1) better than large packs that you have to store in the open2) Lasts longer than regular pack of eight, again because its closed.Disadvantage :More plastic usage than regular pack or tenConclusion:If you are going to consume Maggi over longer period of time but this one, if you will finish pack of ten within a week buy the regular large packs as it saves plastic pollution--

  I just love the 2 minute noodle !Pros-1. Broken during delivery or not, doesnt really matter to me, since I prefer to break them into 2 pieces anyways before I cook them2. This family big pack really is cost effective.3. Nestle maggi has been around for so many decades from my childhood and they have been consistent and have even braved the recent questions raised on the quality of their product!4. Masala taste is ever so tasty5. Cooks really fast...ok not 2, let's say 5mins!Cons-1. Though maggi comes with atta noodles (healthier) than this maggi, the atta maggi is quiet expensive than this normal maggi. How I wish the oats and atta maggi would have been cheaper too

  Maggi is called national food of India, lol. It's tasty and non sticky and can be prepared easily and quickly. So feeling hungry? It's maggi time now.Packaging and delivery was good and prompt. The noodles were recently made so it was a fresh product. Recommend to every age group as a quick snack.

  Review of maggi:Who am I to review Maggi. It's iconic for anyone born in the 80s and 90s.Review of this pack:1) better than large packs that you have to store in the open2) Lasts longer than regular pack of eight, again because its closed.Disadvantage :More plastic usage than regular pack or tenConclusion:If you are going to consume Maggi over longer period of time but this one, if you will finish pack of ten within a week buy the regular large packs as it saves plastic pollution--

  I just love the 2 minute noodle !Pros-1. Broken during delivery or not, doesnt really matter to me, since I prefer to break them into 2 pieces anyways before I cook them2. This family big pack really is cost effective.3. Nestle maggi has been around for so many decades from my childhood and they have been consistent and have even braved the recent questions raised on the quality of their product!4. Masala taste is ever so tasty5. Cooks really fast...ok not 2, let's say 5mins!Cons-1. Though maggi comes with atta noodles (healthier) than this maggi, the atta maggi is quiet expensive than this normal maggi. How I wish the oats and atta maggi would have been cheaper too

Though maggi comes with atta noodles (healthier) than this maggi, the atta maggi is quiet expensive than this normal maggi. How I wish the oats and atta maggi would have been cheaper too

  Maggi is called national food of India, lol. It's tasty and non sticky and can be prepared easily and quickly. So feeling hungry? It's maggi time now.Packaging and delivery was good and prompt. The noodles were recently made so it was a fresh product. Recommend to every age group as a quick snack.

  Review of maggi:Who am I to review Maggi. It's iconic for anyone born in the 80s and 90s.Review of this pack:1) better than large packs that you have to store in the open2) Lasts longer than regular pack of eight, again because its closed.Disadvantage :More plastic usage than regular pack or tenConclusion:If you are going to consume Maggi over longer period of time but this one, if you will finish pack of ten within a week buy the regular large packs as it saves plastic pollution--

  I just love the 2 minute noodle !Pros-1. Broken during delivery or not, doesnt really matter to me, since I prefer to break them into 2 pieces anyways before I cook them2. This family big pack really is cost effective.3. Nestle maggi has been around for so many decades from my childhood and they have been consistent and have even braved the recent questions raised on the quality of their product!4. Masala taste is ever so tasty5. Cooks really fast...ok not 2, let's say 5mins!Cons-1. Though maggi comes with atta noodles (healthier) than this maggi, the atta maggi is quiet expensive than this normal maggi. How I wish the oats and atta maggi would have been cheaper too

  Maggi is called national food of India, lol. It's tasty and non sticky and can be prepared easily and quickly. So feeling hungry? It's maggi time now.Packaging and delivery was good and prompt. The noodles were recently made so it was a fresh product. Recommend to every age group as a quick snack.

  Review of maggi:Who am I to review Maggi. It's iconic for anyone born in the 80s and 90s.Review of this pack:1) better than large packs that you have to store in the open2) Lasts longer than regular pack of eight, again because its closed.Disadvantage :More plastic usage than regular pack or tenConclusion:If you are going to consume Maggi over longer period of time but this one, if you will finish pack of ten within a week buy the regular large packs as it saves plastic pollution--

  I just love the 2 minute noodle !Pros-1. Broken during delivery or not, doesnt really matter to me, since I prefer to break them into 2 pieces anyways before I cook them2. This family big pack really is cost effective.3. Nestle maggi has been around for so many decades from my childhood and they have been consistent and have even braved the recent questions raised on the quality of their product!4. Masala taste is ever so tasty5. Cooks really fast...ok not 2, let's say 5mins!Cons-1. Though maggi comes with atta noodles (healthier) than this maggi, the atta maggi is quiet expensive than this normal maggi. How I wish the oats and atta maggi would have been cheaper too

Though maggi comes with atta noodles (healthier) than this maggi, the atta maggi is quiet expensive than this normal maggi. How I wish the oats and atta maggi would have been cheaper too

  Maggi is called national food of India, lol. It's tasty and non sticky and can be prepared easily and quickly. So feeling hungry? It's maggi time now.Packaging and delivery was good and prompt. The noodles were recently made so it was a fresh product. Recommend to every age group as a quick snack.

  Review of maggi:Who am I to review Maggi. It's iconic for anyone born in the 80s and 90s.Review of this pack:1) better than large packs that you have to store in the open2) Lasts longer than regular pack of eight, again because its closed.Disadvantage :More plastic usage than regular pack or tenConclusion:If you are going to consume Maggi over longer period of time but this one, if you will finish pack of ten within a week buy the regular large packs as it saves plastic pollution--

  I just love the 2 minute noodle !Pros-1. Broken during delivery or not, doesnt really matter to me, since I prefer to break them into 2 pieces anyways before I cook them2. This family big pack really is cost effective.3. Nestle maggi has been around for so many decades from my childhood and they have been consistent and have even braved the recent questions raised on the quality of their product!4. Masala taste is ever so tasty5. Cooks really fast...ok not 2, let's say 5mins!Cons-1. Though maggi comes with atta noodles (healthier) than this maggi, the atta maggi is quiet expensive than this normal maggi. How I wish the oats and atta maggi would have been cheaper too

  Maggi is called national food of India, lol. It's tasty and non sticky and can be prepared easily and quickly. So feeling hungry? It's maggi time now.Packaging and delivery was good and prompt. The noodles were recently made so it was a fresh product. Recommend to every age group as a quick snack.

  Review of maggi:Who am I to review Maggi. It's iconic for anyone born in the 80s and 90s.Review of this pack:1) better than large packs that you have to store in the open2) Lasts longer than regular pack of eight, again because its closed.Disadvantage :More plastic usage than regular pack or tenConclusion:If you are going to consume Maggi over longer period of time but this one, if you will finish pack of ten within a week buy the regular large packs as it saves plastic pollution--

  I just love the 2 minute noodle !Pros-1. Broken during delivery or not, doesnt really matter to me, since I prefer to break them into 2 pieces anyways before I cook them2. This family big pack really is cost effective.3. Nestle maggi has been around for so many decades from my childhood and they have been consistent and have even braved the recent questions raised on the quality of their product!4. Masala taste is ever so tasty5. Cooks really fast...ok not 2, let's say 5mins!Cons-1. Though maggi comes with atta noodles (healthier) than this maggi, the atta maggi is quiet expensive than this normal maggi. How I wish the oats and atta maggi would have been cheaper too

  Maggi is called national food of India, lol. It's tasty and non sticky and can be prepared easily and quickly. So feeling hungry? It's maggi time now.Packaging and delivery was good and prompt. The noodles were recently made so it was a fresh product. Recommend to every age group as a quick snack.

  Review of maggi:Who am I to review Maggi. It's iconic for anyone born in the 80s and 90s.Review of this pack:1) better than large packs that you have to store in the open2) Lasts longer than regular pack of eight, again because its closed.Disadvantage :More plastic usage than regular pack or tenConclusion:If you are going to consume Maggi over longer period of time but this one, if you will finish pack of ten within a week buy the regular large packs as it saves plastic pollution--

  I just love the 2 minute noodle !Pros-1. Broken during delivery or not, doesnt really matter to me, since I prefer to break them into 2 pieces anyways before I cook them2. This family big pack really is cost effective.3. Nestle maggi has been around for so many decades from my childhood and they have been consistent and have even braved the recent questions raised on the quality of their product!4. Masala taste is ever so tasty5. Cooks really fast...ok not 2, let's say 5mins!Cons-1. Though maggi comes with atta noodles (healthier) than this maggi, the atta maggi is quiet expensive than this normal maggi. How I wish the oats and atta maggi would have been cheaper too

It's iconic for anyone born in the 80s and 90s.Review of this pack:1) better than large packs that you have to store in the open2) Lasts longer than regular pack of eight, again because its closed.Disadvantage :More plastic usage than regular pack or tenConclusion:If you are going to consume Maggi over longer period of time but this one, if you will finish pack of ten within a week buy the regular large packs as it saves plastic pollution--

  I just love the 2 minute noodle !Pros-1. Broken during delivery or not, doesnt really matter to me, since I prefer to break them into 2 pieces anyways before I cook them2. This family big pack really is cost effective.3. Nestle maggi has been around for so many decades from my childhood and they have been consistent and have even braved the recent questions raised on the quality of their product!4. Masala taste is ever so tasty5. Cooks really fast...ok not 2, let's say 5mins!Cons-1. Though maggi comes with atta noodles (healthier) than this maggi, the atta maggi is quiet expensive than this normal maggi. How I wish the oats and atta maggi would have been cheaper too

  Maggi is called national food of India, lol. It's tasty and non sticky and can be prepared easily and quickly. So feeling hungry? It's maggi time now.Packaging and delivery was good and prompt. The noodles were recently made so it was a fresh product. Recommend to every age group as a quick snack.

  Review of maggi:Who am I to review Maggi. It's iconic for anyone born in the 80s and 90s.Review of this pack:1) better than large packs that you have to store in the open2) Lasts longer than regular pack of eight, again because its closed.Disadvantage :More plastic usage than regular pack or tenConclusion:If you are going to consume Maggi over longer period of time but this one, if you will finish pack of ten within a week buy the regular large packs as it saves plastic pollution--

  I just love the 2 minute noodle !Pros-1. Broken during delivery or not, doesnt really matter to me, since I prefer to break them into 2 pieces anyways before I cook them2. This family big pack really is cost effective.3. Nestle maggi has been around for so many decades from my childhood and they have been consistent and have even braved the recent questions raised on the quality of their product!4. Masala taste is ever so tasty5. Cooks really fast...ok not 2, let's say 5mins!Cons-1. Though maggi comes with atta noodles (healthier) than this maggi, the atta maggi is quiet expensive than this normal maggi. How I wish the oats and atta maggi would have been cheaper too

Though maggi comes with atta noodles (healthier) than this maggi, the atta maggi is quiet expensive than this normal maggi. How I wish the oats and atta maggi would have been cheaper too

  Maggi is called national food of India, lol. It's tasty and non sticky and can be prepared easily and quickly. So feeling hungry? It's maggi time now.Packaging and delivery was good and prompt. The noodles were recently made so it was a fresh product. Recommend to every age group as a quick snack.

  Review of maggi:Who am I to review Maggi. It's iconic for anyone born in the 80s and 90s.Review of this pack:1) better than large packs that you have to store in the open2) Lasts longer than regular pack of eight, again because its closed.Disadvantage :More plastic usage than regular pack or tenConclusion:If you are going to consume Maggi over longer period of time but this one, if you will finish pack of ten within a week buy the regular large packs as it saves plastic pollution--
