1,"Damage .. flavor , presentation and value for money",2020-01-07
1,Never buy maggi from Amazon it seemed to be duplicate product the taste was very bad and had got insect's inside,2019-10-02
5,"Since the Maggi controversy the taste of Maggi has changed since then. But me as a kid loved Maggi then and I also love Maggi now, though the taste has changed a bit and Maggi should definitely change the pack a bit üòçüòç",2019-10-31
3,Maggie is maggie but the packaging was horrible and they broke all the packates into powder,2020-06-13
5,What can you expect when local market is out of stock for Maggie and Amazon delivering it. The entire pack vanished in 1 week. and the stock is gone here too. Wishing to purchase again.,2020-05-24
1,"I would say the quality of the product was poor, All packets were crushed into dust by the time it delivered",2020-06-19
4,"It's original one, what more can I say about Maggie. üòÑIt's better if you're getting them in an offer. The least I can say about the deal. Baki Maggie to same hi hai.",2018-10-17
5,Good product and good packaging... Only drawback is price not mentioned on each pack ... But its ok... And also this seller normaly take 100rs  extra delivery charges... But i order when its Amazon fulfilled and no extra charges. So its best deal... Grab it without delivery cahrges other wise local market recommended.,2019-07-15
2,"This pack manufacturing month is close to order month, but watch out for broken noodles quite often, the pack isnt open or bad but due to handling the noodles inside will be in pieces",2020-07-05
5,"What to write about Maggi. If the price is less the INR 130 Good, Great @ INR120 and Wow below INR 120",2020-03-14
4,"We Indian consumers are well aware of the taste, flavour and value for money of Maggi noodles.So will quickly jump to Amazon service.Yes, all the packets were delivered safely without damage/break to packets.",2020-05-22
2,The packet was damaged with little holes and cuts . A few ants were seen inside packages too.,2020-05-16
5,Very good discount on the pack,2018-07-31
3,Please don't dispatch in Cover .At least u provide box.,2020-07-08
5,Love this product..I love Maggie so so much..üòçüòò,2019-01-27
5,"overall, it's anice thing to purchase. the packaging was good and I got 12 packets of Maggi, at the price of 143. As this product is not available anywhere around my local market, I was elated when I got the package.Thank you Amazon",2020-05-05
3,Since childhood im eating maggi i never forget how it taste i order 2 packs basically there is no taste in magi masala i was surprise more 6 i ate i feel there is no taste idk why,2020-03-19
5,"Costs Rs 100-110 varying each time I buy it.Sort of like buy 10, get 2 free.Only 1 concern - packing is not so good! 1 or 2 maggi packets get a bit crushed/crumbled.",2019-10-06
5,Product was good but the package could have been better. It not even came up in bubble wrap which caused damage to a few packets.,2020-06-05
5,The noodles that I get in local stores will be very salty. This noodles I feel very original in terms of flavour. Remember good olden days of 90s kids Maggi ? 15 years before etc. It's giving that original flavour when Maggi was launched in India . Worth the buy,2020-04-27
4,You know what people This Maggi Just taste much better than the normal Maggi that we buy in stores or markets it's just taste good and the price is decent and the taste is also üëå good recommend you'll to buy it,2019-01-17
1,"Each packet size is less than a Rs.10 maggi packet ,so obviously it contains less noodles in each packet,but it costs Rs.144 for 12 packets pack and make us fool by filling small packet.",2019-03-17
5,"There is no point discussing the taste because well , Maggi is Maggi .The was it is packaged is that the 12 individual packets are inside an outer transparent packet with Maggi branding , suggesting that it is packaged this way at the factory , so you only have the wash the outet packaging and not the indiviual packets when it arrives at your doorstep instead of the individual packet reducing the hastle during this pandemic .If you can get it at a off , it is an pretty decent deal .",2020-08-13
3,I never even expected that I would receive Maggi this way. I've ordered before from Amazon pantry and they arrived perfectly. But this time almost all packets are crumbled. It feels like someone might've put this packet under some heavy thing. I'm so disappointed. I will not buy Maggi for Amazon again. It didn't even had a cartoon box.,2020-07-04
5,Very good and value worthy combo pack . It comes in transparent Nestle wrapper where it helps all 12 packs together . As usual flavour is also very tasty and perfect for tiffin or snack. I expect to get more combo like this from Nestle  .,2020-04-29
1,"Maggi is losing its cham though, there taste is also not what it used to be and after eating it u will feel heaviness in ur stomach. I have switched to patantaji classic atta noodles now, my final good by to maggi.",2018-11-19
5,My favourite maagi...this was very tasty and attractive.....and packing was nice very well but late delivered one day.... thank you and others things are rights.,2020-03-03
1,"I think the batch I received is defective, we have been eating maggi since childhood, but this maggi breaks as soon as I open the packet, the noodles are loose and not firm as they usually are, and they taste bad too. I just tried once, and I think I have to throw the other 11.the packet says that it is not expired, bt i think they send really old packets..",2020-07-04
5,This product needs no introduction.  Simply the best noodles.  Amazon should give some discount on this atleast.,2020-07-06
5,The product tastes good since it is brand of maggi.Packaging was very good.I always wanted different packets seperately since i don't want to open big pack and make only 1.The product is also very cheap with amazon.,2019-04-13
5,"Same as the market, same flavour.Value for money since you get it delivered at your home, from a distant location at the same price as market, will definitely recommend buying.",2020-06-19

5,"Best product always. Delicious and Fulfilling.  I prefer smallest packs because it's very easy to use when cooking single pack. Packing was great, all packs were intact no breakage. Fresh packs by manufacturing date. Recommended.",2018-06-30
5,Maggi is one of the best snacks in present day . It is very easy to make and serve. It is also available in many price range. Its masala makes it much better in taste .i and my family take it regular .whenever I am alone in house only thing that I made is maggi. It has its own taste and also the best present in market .,2019-09-13
1,Dislike because packet damage received only 5minut mane unke samne bola ki wapas kar lijiye to bole ki kal returned kar digiyega,2019-01-28
5,Add Carrot and tomatoes (Boil them for 8 Minutes) before adding it to Maggi Mix.- this will decrease the intense spiciness and make it soothing.- Will give a creme texture to the noodles - tastes awesome.- Improve your skin quality (Glowing and White Skin).  Good to health  - Better in taste.,2019-06-09

2,"This particular Maggi Noodles variant does not taste or look good.Definitely not as good as Maggi Atta Noodles or Special Masala Maggi Noodles.I would avoid this , but would definitely opt for Maggi Atta Noodles any time.",2018-12-26
2,"To be honest this particular maggie 2 mins noodles looks suspicious & tastes weired. Why so?Suspicious: The 2 mins instant noodles is like no other maggie noodles i are before. After 10 mins of soaking in hot water is still not soft enough. It stays skinny stiff & not properly soaked.Weired: It tastes different. Not like normal maggie I've eaten before, which were bought from BB/Market. It doesn't taste bad but not good either. The typical maggie flavour is missing.Product has a manufacturing date of May, 2020 & 9 months to go till expiry.Looks totally original.Well packed 12 seperate packets of maggie instant noodles.To buy or not? Make a choice yourself.",2020-06-22
1,"Firstly,Packets are much smaller in size.

It's iconic for anyone born in the 80s and 90s.Review of this pack:1) better than large packs that you have to store in the open2) Lasts longer than regular pack of eight, again because its closed.Disadvantage :More plastic usage than regular pack or tenConclusion:If you are going to consume Maggi over longer period of time but this one, if you will finish pack of ten within a week buy the regular large packs as it saves plastic pollution--",2019-05-30

5,"I just love the 2 minute noodle !Pros-1. Broken during delivery or not, doesnt really matter to me, since I prefer to break them into 2 pieces anyways before I cook them2. This family big pack really is cost effective.3. Nestle maggi has been around for so many decades from my childhood and they have been consistent and have even braved the recent questions raised on the quality of their product!4. Masala taste is ever so tasty5. Cooks really fast...ok not 2, let's say 5mins!Cons-1. Though maggi comes with atta noodles (healthier) than this maggi, the atta maggi is quiet expensive than this normal maggi. How I wish the oats and atta maggi would have been cheaper too",2018-10-11

1,Worst packaging Amazon. Packet is broken. Maggie pieces came out of it and spread in the whole pantry carton. I have full faith on Amazon and their packaging but this is undesirable. My faith is shaken. How can pack like this for consumable item.,2017-10-03

3,"I had to give it up completely since October 17 as I started suffering with joint pain (pseudo gout). I used to eat two portions of it, sometimes twice daily since I was hooked on it since child hood. Now we buy it only for the family. Feel sad that I am unable to enjoy my favourite comfort food anymore.Small complaint that the noodles are received in crumbled condition too often.",2018-01-06
5,Grew up with Maggi Chicken flavor but as they screwed up the flavor and noodle consistency...switched overvto the Masala flavor. Thats it...can relish it even thrice a day with a dash of Chicken Maggi cube or/and some strong Hing ( Urban Platter Afghan Hing). Sometimes do add Amul cheese cube or even Tuna chunks for a feast....,2017-08-22
1,Got product of Manufacturing date of March. Already 4 months old.,2017-07-29

4,"2 packets were intact but in the third packet, one of the 8-pieces were broken (seems It was from the fulfillment center only). But It's negotiable and avoidable for such items (as It was not completely broken).",2018-03-04

1,Ultraprocessed foods like maggi are manufactured after several levels of processing that include artificial treatment that is very harmful to the human body. Please don't get fooled by the misleading advertisements shown in tv that it is made of wheat and other things. Its a complete marketing strategy. Please avoid it at all costs and save your life.,2018-02-18

3,"On the surface, I'd say it is good. But thinking more deeply about the reality and the futility of trying to comprehend the true nature of things, the answer could be anything good or bad which you can choose. It is good Maggi  if we have a common construct to define what actually qualifies as good Maggi truly is or isn't. Since I can't b sure you experience the concept of ""Maggi"" in the same way I do, I can't adequately review for you.",2018-09-06
1,These maagi noodles are banned in India because of it contains nearly 21 dangerous ingredients that will harm your stomach and leads to cancer. So it was banned in India. Evev though these amazon selling it because they want only buyers not about their health or rules.,2019-12-20
