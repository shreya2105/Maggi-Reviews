  Maggi is called national food of India, lol. It's tasty and non sticky and can be prepared easily and quickly. So feeling hungry? It's maggi time now.Packaging and delivery was good and prompt. The noodles were recently made so it was a fresh product. Recommend to every age group as a quick snack.

  Review of maggi:Who am I to review Maggi. It's iconic for anyone born in the 80s and 90s.Review of this pack:1) better than large packs that you have to store in the open2) Lasts longer than regular pack of eight, again because its closed.Disadvantage :More plastic usage than regular pack or tenConclusion:If you are going to consume Maggi over longer period of time but this one, if you will finish pack of ten within a week buy the regular large packs as it saves plastic pollution--

  I just love the 2 minute noodle !Pros-1. Broken during delivery or not, doesnt really matter to me, since I prefer to break them into 2 pieces anyways before I cook them2. This family big pack really is cost effective.3. Nestle maggi has been around for so many decades from my childhood and they have been consistent and have even braved the recent questions raised on the quality of their product!4. Masala taste is ever so tasty5. Cooks really fast...ok not 2, let's say 5mins!Cons-1. Though maggi comes with atta noodles (healthier) than this maggi, the atta maggi is quiet expensive than this normal maggi. How I wish the oats and atta maggi would have been cheaper too

  Be wise. Don't purchase this. Walk an extra mile but DO NOT ORDER THIS. Or just like me, you too would end up with a pack completely crushed. I can barely make out 2-3 pieces. The rest are a crumbled heap.

  Maggi noodles is something I grew up with but it was chicken flavor then.Since the original chicken flavor isn't the same anymore, switched to this Masala flavor.We add a whole lot of taste maker ingredients to change the final flavor of the noodles and works flawlessly.Happy with the guaranteed quality abd glad to have the noodles back on the shelf.

  I had to give it up completely since October 17 as I started suffering with joint pain (pseudo gout). I used to eat two portions of it, sometimes twice daily since I was hooked on it since child hood. Now we buy it only for the family. Feel sad that I am unable to enjoy my favourite comfort food anymore.Small complaint that the noodles are received in crumbled condition too often.

  Grew up with Maggi Chicken flavor but as they screwed up the flavor and noodle consistency...switched overvto the Masala flavor. Thats it...can relish it even thrice a day with a dash of Chicken Maggi cube or/and some strong Hing ( Urban Platter Afghan Hing). Sometimes do add Amul cheese cube or even Tuna chunks for a feast....

  Ultraprocessed foods like maggi are manufactured after several levels of processing that include artificial treatment that is very harmful to the human body. Please don't get fooled by the misleading advertisements shown in tv that it is made of wheat and other things. Its a complete marketing strategy. Please avoid it at all costs and save your life.

  Most convenient and easily available instant noodles - their flavour is good but not as good as it used to be 10 years ago. They‚Äôre not healthy, but they‚Äôre so convenient that you just can‚Äôt give up on them. Anyone can make them - all you need to do is boil water and put noodles and the masala in it.

  On the surface, I'd say it is good. But thinking more deeply about the reality and the futility of trying to comprehend the true nature of things, the answer could be anything good or bad which you can choose. It is good Maggi  if we have a common construct to define what actually qualifies as good Maggi truly is or isn't. Since I can't b sure you experience the concept of ""Maggi"" in the same way I do, I can't adequately review for you.
