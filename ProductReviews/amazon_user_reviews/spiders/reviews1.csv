  There is no point discussing the taste because well , Maggi is Maggi .The was it is packaged is that the 12 individual packets are inside an outer transparent packet with Maggi branding , suggesting that it is packaged this way at the factory , so you only have the wash the outet packaging and not the indiviual packets when it arrives at your doorstep instead of the individual packet reducing the hastle during this pandemic .If you can get it at a off , it is an pretty decent deal .

  Add Carrot and tomatoes (Boil them for 8 Minutes) before adding it to Maggi Mix.- this will decrease the intense spiciness and make it soothing.- Will give a creme texture to the noodles - tastes awesome.- Improve your skin quality (Glowing and White Skin).  Good to health  - Better in taste.

  To be honest this particular maggie 2 mins noodles looks suspicious & tastes weired. Why so?Suspicious: The 2 mins instant noodles is like no other maggie noodles i are before. After 10 mins of soaking in hot water is still not soft enough. It stays skinny stiff & not properly soaked.Weired: It tastes different. Not like normal maggie I've eaten before, which were bought from BB/Market. It doesn't taste bad but not good either. The typical maggie flavour is missing.Product has a manufacturing date of May, 2020 & 9 months to go till expiry.Looks totally original.Well packed 12 seperate packets of maggie instant noodles.To buy or not? Make a choice yourself.

  Small portions in each pack and compared To the earlier packs even the tastemaker is much less so the entire pack is a waste. Noodles turn out sticky. This pack is completely different from the other maggi noodles. Either it‚Äôs fake or they have made it specially for the lockdown.

  Don't compare these to Lipton,Nissin, or Knorr brands. Their not bad by any means. But if your used to the former brands then these will take some time to get used to.
