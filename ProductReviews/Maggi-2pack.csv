  Best product always. Delicious and Fulfilling.  I prefer smallest packs because it's very easy to use when cooking single pack. Packing was great, all packs were intact no breakage. Fresh packs by manufacturing date. Recommended.

  Maggi is one of the best snacks in present day . It is very easy to make and serve. It is also available in many price range. Its masala makes it much better in taste .i and my family take it regular .whenever I am alone in house only thing that I made is maggi. It has its own taste and also the best present in market .

  Add Carrot and tomatoes (Boil them for 8 Minutes) before adding it to Maggi Mix.- this will decrease the intense spiciness and make it soothing.- Will give a creme texture to the noodles - tastes awesome.- Improve your skin quality (Glowing and White Skin).  Good to health  - Better in taste.

  This particular Maggi Noodles variant does not taste or look good.Definitely not as good as Maggi Atta Noodles or Special Masala Maggi Noodles.I would avoid this , but would definitely opt for Maggi Atta Noodles any time.

  To be honest this particular maggie 2 mins noodles looks suspicious & tastes weired. Why so?Suspicious: The 2 mins instant noodles is like no other maggie noodles i are before. After 10 mins of soaking in hot water is still not soft enough. It stays skinny stiff & not properly soaked.Weired: It tastes different. Not like normal maggie I've eaten before, which were bought from BB/Market. It doesn't taste bad but not good either. The typical maggie flavour is missing.Product has a manufacturing date of May, 2020 & 9 months to go till expiry.Looks totally original.Well packed 12 seperate packets of maggie instant noodles.To buy or not? Make a choice yourself.

  Firstly,Packets are much smaller in size. They are not the same as ""Rs12 packet""which are available in market.They are approx half of that packing.And secondly, there is no price mention on the packets.These packets are very small, worth value Rs6 per packet.Please dont buy from this seller.

  To be honest this particular maggie 2 mins noodles looks suspicious & tastes weired. Why so?Suspicious: The 2 mins instant noodles is like no other maggie noodles i are before. After 10 mins of soaking in hot water is still not soft enough. It stays skinny stiff & not properly soaked.Weired: It tastes different. Not like normal maggie I've eaten before, which were bought from BB/Market. It doesn't taste bad but not good either. The typical maggie flavour is missing.Product has a manufacturing date of May, 2020 & 9 months to go till expiry.Looks totally original.Well packed 12 seperate packets of maggie instant noodles.To buy or not? Make a choice yourself.

  Firstly,Packets are much smaller in size. They are not the same as ""Rs12 packet""which are available in market.They are approx half of that packing.And secondly, there is no price mention on the packets.These packets are very small, worth value Rs6 per packet.Please dont buy from this seller.

  Maggi is one of the best snacks in present day . It is very easy to make and serve. It is also available in many price range.

  Add Carrot and tomatoes (Boil them for 8 Minutes) before adding it to Maggi Mix.- this will decrease the intense spiciness and make it soothing.- Will give a creme texture to the noodles - tastes awesome.- Improve your skin quality (Glowing and White Skin).  Good to health  - Better in taste.

  Add Carrot and tomatoes (Boil them for 8 Minutes) before adding it to Maggi Mix.- this will decrease the intense spiciness and make it soothing.- Will give a creme texture to the noodles - tastes awesome.- Improve your skin quality (Glowing and White Skin).  Good to health  - Better in taste.

  This particular Maggi Noodles variant does not taste or look good.Definitely not as good as Maggi Atta Noodles or Special Masala Maggi Noodles.I would avoid this , but would definitely opt for Maggi Atta Noodles any time.

  To be honest this particular maggie 2 mins noodles looks suspicious & tastes weired. Why so?Suspicious: The 2 mins instant noodles is like no other maggie noodles i are before. After 10 mins of soaking in hot water is still not soft enough. It stays skinny stiff & not properly soaked.Weired: It tastes different. Not like normal maggie I've eaten before, which were bought from BB/Market. It doesn't taste bad but not good either. The typical maggie flavour is missing.Product has a manufacturing date of May, 2020 & 9 months to go till expiry.Looks totally original.Well packed 12 seperate packets of maggie instant noodles.To buy or not? Make a choice yourself.

  Firstly,Packets are much smaller in size. They are not the same as ""Rs12 packet""which are available in market.They are approx half of that packing.And secondly, there is no price mention on the packets.These packets are very small, worth value Rs6 per packet.Please dont buy from this seller.

The typical maggie flavour is missing.Product has a manufacturing date of May, 2020 & 9 months to go till expiry.Looks totally original.Well packed 12 seperate packets of maggie instant noodles.To buy or not? Make a choice yourself.

  Firstly,Packets are much smaller in size. They are not the same as ""Rs12 packet""which are available in market.They are approx half of that packing.And secondly, there is no price mention on the packets.These packets are very small, worth value Rs6 per packet.Please dont buy from this seller.

  Best product always. Delicious and Fulfilling.  I prefer smallest packs because it's very easy to use when cooking single pack. Packing was great, all packs were intact no breakage. Fresh packs by manufacturing date. Recommended.

  Add Carrot and tomatoes (Boil them for 8 Minutes) before adding it to Maggi Mix.- this will decrease the intense spiciness and make it soothing.- Will give a creme texture to the noodles - tastes awesome.- Improve your skin quality (Glowing and White Skin).  Good to health  - Better in taste.

  This particular Maggi Noodles variant does not taste or look good.Definitely not as good as Maggi Atta Noodles or Special Masala Maggi Noodles.I would avoid this , but would definitely opt for Maggi Atta Noodles any time.

  To be honest this particular maggie 2 mins noodles looks suspicious & tastes weired. Why so?Suspicious: The 2 mins instant noodles is like no other maggie noodles i are before. After 10 mins of soaking in hot water is still not soft enough. It stays skinny stiff & not properly soaked.Weired: It tastes different. Not like normal maggie I've eaten before, which were bought from BB/Market. It doesn't taste bad but not good either. The typical maggie flavour is missing.Product has a manufacturing date of May, 2020 & 9 months to go till expiry.Looks totally original.Well packed 12 seperate packets of maggie instant noodles.To buy or not? Make a choice yourself.

  Firstly,Packets are much smaller in size. They are not the same as ""Rs12 packet""which are available in market.They are approx half of that packing.And secondly, there is no price mention on the packets.These packets are very small, worth value Rs6 per packet.Please dont buy from this seller.

  Best product always. Delicious and Fulfilling.  I prefer smallest packs because it's very easy to use when cooking single pack. Packing was great, all packs were intact no breakage. Fresh packs by manufacturing date. Recommended.

  Maggi is one of the best snacks in present day . It is very easy to make and serve. It is also available in many price range. Its masala makes it much better in taste .i and my family take it regular .whenever I am alone in house only thing that I made is maggi. It has its own taste and also the best present in market .

  Add Carrot and tomatoes (Boil them for 8 Minutes) before adding it to Maggi Mix.- this will decrease the intense spiciness and make it soothing.- Will give a creme texture to the noodles - tastes awesome.- Improve your skin quality (Glowing and White Skin).  Good to health  - Better in taste.

  This particular Maggi Noodles variant does not taste or look good.Definitely not as good as Maggi Atta Noodles or Special Masala Maggi Noodles.I would avoid this , but would definitely opt for Maggi Atta Noodles any time.

  To be honest this particular maggie 2 mins noodles looks suspicious & tastes weired. Why so?Suspicious: The 2 mins instant noodles is like no other maggie noodles i are before. After 10 mins of soaking in hot water is still not soft enough. It stays skinny stiff & not properly soaked.Weired: It tastes different. Not like normal maggie I've eaten before, which were bought from BB/Market. It doesn't taste bad but not good either. The typical maggie flavour is missing.Product has a manufacturing date of May, 2020 & 9 months to go till expiry.Looks totally original.Well packed 12 seperate packets of maggie instant noodles.To buy or not? Make a choice yourself.

  Firstly,Packets are much smaller in size. They are not the same as ""Rs12 packet""which are available in market.They are approx half of that packing.And secondly, there is no price mention on the packets.These packets are very small, worth value Rs6 per packet.Please dont buy from this seller.

The typical maggie flavour is missing.Product has a manufacturing date of May, 2020 & 9 months to go till expiry.Looks totally original.Well packed 12 seperate packets of maggie instant noodles.To buy or not? Make a choice yourself.

  Firstly,Packets are much smaller in size. They are not the same as ""Rs12 packet""which are available in market.They are approx half of that packing.And secondly, there is no price mention on the packets.These packets are very small, worth value Rs6 per packet.Please dont buy from this seller.

  Add Carrot and tomatoes (Boil them for 8 Minutes) before adding it to Maggi Mix.- this will decrease the intense spiciness and make it soothing.- Will give a creme texture to the noodles - tastes awesome.- Improve your skin quality (Glowing and White Skin).  Good to health  - Better in taste.

  Add Carrot and tomatoes (Boil them for 8 Minutes) before adding it to Maggi Mix.- this will decrease the intense spiciness and make it soothing.- Will give a creme texture to the noodles - tastes awesome.- Improve your skin quality (Glowing and White Skin).  Good to health  - Better in taste.

  This particular Maggi Noodles variant does not taste or look good.Definitely not as good as Maggi Atta Noodles or Special Masala Maggi Noodles.I would avoid this , but would definitely opt for Maggi Atta Noodles any time.

  To be honest this particular maggie 2 mins noodles looks suspicious & tastes weired. Why so?Suspicious: The 2 mins instant noodles is like no other maggie noodles i are before. After 10 mins of soaking in hot water is still not soft enough. It stays skinny stiff & not properly soaked.Weired: It tastes different. Not like normal maggie I've eaten before, which were bought from BB/Market. It doesn't taste bad but not good either. The typical maggie flavour is missing.Product has a manufacturing date of May, 2020 & 9 months to go till expiry.Looks totally original.Well packed 12 seperate packets of maggie instant noodles.To buy or not? Make a choice yourself.

  Firstly,Packets are much smaller in size. They are not the same as ""Rs12 packet""which are available in market.They are approx half of that packing.And secondly, there is no price mention on the packets.These packets are very small, worth value Rs6 per packet.Please dont buy from this seller.

  Best product always. Delicious and Fulfilling.  I prefer smallest packs because it's very easy to use when cooking single pack. Packing was great, all packs were intact no breakage. Fresh packs by manufacturing date. Recommended.

  Maggi is one of the best snacks in present day . It is very easy to make and serve. It is also available in many price range. Its masala makes it much better in taste .i and my family take it regular .whenever I am alone in house only thing that I made is maggi. It has its own taste and also the best present in market .

  Add Carrot and tomatoes (Boil them for 8 Minutes) before adding it to Maggi Mix.- this will decrease the intense spiciness and make it soothing.- Will give a creme texture to the noodles - tastes awesome.- Improve your skin quality (Glowing and White Skin).  Good to health  - Better in taste.

  This particular Maggi Noodles variant does not taste or look good.Definitely not as good as Maggi Atta Noodles or Special Masala Maggi Noodles.I would avoid this , but would definitely opt for Maggi Atta Noodles any time.

  To be honest this particular maggie 2 mins noodles looks suspicious & tastes weired. Why so?Suspicious: The 2 mins instant noodles is like no other maggie noodles i are before. After 10 mins of soaking in hot water is still not soft enough. It stays skinny stiff & not properly soaked.Weired: It tastes different. Not like normal maggie I've eaten before, which were bought from BB/Market. It doesn't taste bad but not good either. The typical maggie flavour is missing.Product has a manufacturing date of May, 2020 & 9 months to go till expiry.Looks totally original.Well packed 12 seperate packets of maggie instant noodles.To buy or not? Make a choice yourself.

  Firstly,Packets are much smaller in size. They are not the same as ""Rs12 packet""which are available in market.They are approx half of that packing.And secondly, there is no price mention on the packets.These packets are very small, worth value Rs6 per packet.Please dont buy from this seller.

After 10 mins of soaking in hot water is still not soft enough. It stays skinny stiff & not properly soaked.Weired: It tastes different. Not like normal maggie I've eaten before, which were bought from BB/Market. It doesn't taste bad but not good either. The typical maggie flavour is missing.Product has a manufacturing date of May, 2020 & 9 months to go till expiry.Looks totally original.Well packed 12 seperate packets of maggie instant noodles.To buy or not? Make a choice yourself.

  Add Carrot and tomatoes (Boil them for 8 Minutes) before adding it to Maggi Mix.- this will decrease the intense spiciness and make it soothing.- Will give a creme texture to the noodles - tastes awesome.- Improve your skin quality (Glowing and White Skin).  Good to health  - Better in taste.

  Add Carrot and tomatoes (Boil them for 8 Minutes) before adding it to Maggi Mix.- this will decrease the intense spiciness and make it soothing.- Will give a creme texture to the noodles - tastes awesome.- Improve your skin quality (Glowing and White Skin).  Good to health  - Better in taste.

  This particular Maggi Noodles variant does not taste or look good.Definitely not as good as Maggi Atta Noodles or Special Masala Maggi Noodles.I would avoid this , but would definitely opt for Maggi Atta Noodles any time.

  To be honest this particular maggie 2 mins noodles looks suspicious & tastes weired. Why so?Suspicious: The 2 mins instant noodles is like no other maggie noodles i are before. After 10 mins of soaking in hot water is still not soft enough. It stays skinny stiff & not properly soaked.Weired: It tastes different. Not like normal maggie I've eaten before, which were bought from BB/Market. It doesn't taste bad but not good either. The typical maggie flavour is missing.Product has a manufacturing date of May, 2020 & 9 months to go till expiry.Looks totally original.Well packed 12 seperate packets of maggie instant noodles.To buy or not? Make a choice yourself.

  Firstly,Packets are much smaller in size. They are not the same as ""Rs12 packet""which are available in market.They are approx half of that packing.And secondly, there is no price mention on the packets.These packets are very small, worth value Rs6 per packet.Please dont buy from this seller.

The typical maggie flavour is missing.Product has a manufacturing date of May, 2020 & 9 months to go till expiry.Looks totally original.Well packed 12 seperate packets of maggie instant noodles.To buy or not? Make a choice yourself.

  Firstly,Packets are much smaller in size. They are not the same as ""Rs12 packet""which are available in market.They are approx half of that packing.And secondly, there is no price mention on the packets.These packets are very small, worth value Rs6 per packet.Please dont buy from this seller.

  Add Carrot and tomatoes (Boil them for 8 Minutes) before adding it to Maggi Mix.- this will decrease the intense spiciness and make it soothing.- Will give a creme texture to the noodles - tastes awesome.- Improve your skin quality (Glowing and White Skin).  Good to health  - Better in taste.

  This particular Maggi Noodles variant does not taste or look good.Definitely not as good as Maggi Atta Noodles or Special Masala Maggi Noodles.I would avoid this , but would definitely opt for Maggi Atta Noodles any time.

  To be honest this particular maggie 2 mins noodles looks suspicious & tastes weired. Why so?Suspicious: The 2 mins instant noodles is like no other maggie noodles i are before. After 10 mins of soaking in hot water is still not soft enough. It stays skinny stiff & not properly soaked.Weired: It tastes different. Not like normal maggie I've eaten before, which were bought from BB/Market. It doesn't taste bad but not good either. The typical maggie flavour is missing.Product has a manufacturing date of May, 2020 & 9 months to go till expiry.Looks totally original.Well packed 12 seperate packets of maggie instant noodles.To buy or not? Make a choice yourself.

  Firstly,Packets are much smaller in size. They are not the same as ""Rs12 packet""which are available in market.They are approx half of that packing.And secondly, there is no price mention on the packets.These packets are very small, worth value Rs6 per packet.Please dont buy from this seller.

  Add Carrot and tomatoes (Boil them for 8 Minutes) before adding it to Maggi Mix.- this will decrease the intense spiciness and make it soothing.- Will give a creme texture to the noodles - tastes awesome.- Improve your skin quality (Glowing and White Skin).  Good to health  - Better in taste.

  Add Carrot and tomatoes (Boil them for 8 Minutes) before adding it to Maggi Mix.- this will decrease the intense spiciness and make it soothing.- Will give a creme texture to the noodles - tastes awesome.- Improve your skin quality (Glowing and White Skin).  Good to health  - Better in taste.

  This particular Maggi Noodles variant does not taste or look good.Definitely not as good as Maggi Atta Noodles or Special Masala Maggi Noodles.I would avoid this , but would definitely opt for Maggi Atta Noodles any time.

  To be honest this particular maggie 2 mins noodles looks suspicious & tastes weired. Why so?Suspicious: The 2 mins instant noodles is like no other maggie noodles i are before. After 10 mins of soaking in hot water is still not soft enough. It stays skinny stiff & not properly soaked.Weired: It tastes different. Not like normal maggie I've eaten before, which were bought from BB/Market. It doesn't taste bad but not good either. The typical maggie flavour is missing.Product has a manufacturing date of May, 2020 & 9 months to go till expiry.Looks totally original.Well packed 12 seperate packets of maggie instant noodles.To buy or not? Make a choice yourself.

  Firstly,Packets are much smaller in size. They are not the same as ""Rs12 packet""which are available in market.They are approx half of that packing.And secondly, there is no price mention on the packets.These packets are very small, worth value Rs6 per packet.Please dont buy from this seller.

  Add Carrot and tomatoes (Boil them for 8 Minutes) before adding it to Maggi Mix.- this will decrease the intense spiciness and make it soothing.- Will give a creme texture to the noodles - tastes awesome.- Improve your skin quality (Glowing and White Skin).  Good to health  - Better in taste.

  This particular Maggi Noodles variant does not taste or look good.Definitely not as good as Maggi Atta Noodles or Special Masala Maggi Noodles.I would avoid this , but would definitely opt for Maggi Atta Noodles any time.

  To be honest this particular maggie 2 mins noodles looks suspicious & tastes weired. Why so?Suspicious: The 2 mins instant noodles is like no other maggie noodles i are before. After 10 mins of soaking in hot water is still not soft enough. It stays skinny stiff & not properly soaked.Weired: It tastes different. Not like normal maggie I've eaten before, which were bought from BB/Market. It doesn't taste bad but not good either. The typical maggie flavour is missing.Product has a manufacturing date of May, 2020 & 9 months to go till expiry.Looks totally original.Well packed 12 seperate packets of maggie instant noodles.To buy or not? Make a choice yourself.

  Firstly,Packets are much smaller in size. They are not the same as ""Rs12 packet""which are available in market.They are approx half of that packing.And secondly, there is no price mention on the packets.These packets are very small, worth value Rs6 per packet.Please dont buy from this seller.

  Add Carrot and tomatoes (Boil them for 8 Minutes) before adding it to Maggi Mix.- this will decrease the intense spiciness and make it soothing.- Will give a creme texture to the noodles - tastes awesome.- Improve your skin quality (Glowing and White Skin).  Good to health  - Better in taste.

  To be honest this particular maggie 2 mins noodles looks suspicious & tastes weired. Why so?Suspicious: The 2 mins instant noodles is like no other maggie noodles i are before. After 10 mins of soaking in hot water is still not soft enough. It stays skinny stiff & not properly soaked.Weired: It tastes different. Not like normal maggie I've eaten before, which were bought from BB/Market. It doesn't taste bad but not good either. The typical maggie flavour is missing.Product has a manufacturing date of May, 2020 & 9 months to go till expiry.Looks totally original.Well packed 12 seperate packets of maggie instant noodles.To buy or not? Make a choice yourself.

Not like normal maggie I've eaten before, which were bought from BB/Market. It doesn't taste bad but not good either. The typical maggie flavour is missing.Product has a manufacturing date of May, 2020 & 9 months to go till expiry.Looks totally original.Well packed 12 seperate packets of maggie instant noodles.To buy or not? Make a choice yourself.

  Firstly,Packets are much smaller in size. They are not the same as ""Rs12 packet""which are available in market.They are approx half of that packing.And secondly, there is no price mention on the packets.These packets are very small, worth value Rs6 per packet.Please dont buy from this seller.

  Add Carrot and tomatoes (Boil them for 8 Minutes) before adding it to Maggi Mix.- this will decrease the intense spiciness and make it soothing.- Will give a creme texture to the noodles - tastes awesome.- Improve your skin quality (Glowing and White Skin).  Good to health  - Better in taste.

  Add Carrot and tomatoes (Boil them for 8 Minutes) before adding it to Maggi Mix.- this will decrease the intense spiciness and make it soothing.- Will give a creme texture to the noodles - tastes awesome.- Improve your skin quality (Glowing and White Skin).  Good to health  - Better in taste.

  This particular Maggi Noodles variant does not taste or look good.Definitely not as good as Maggi Atta Noodles or Special Masala Maggi Noodles.I would avoid this , but would definitely opt for Maggi Atta Noodles any time.

  To be honest this particular maggie 2 mins noodles looks suspicious & tastes weired. Why so?Suspicious: The 2 mins instant noodles is like no other maggie noodles i are before. After 10 mins of soaking in hot water is still not soft enough. It stays skinny stiff & not properly soaked.Weired: It tastes different. Not like normal maggie I've eaten before, which were bought from BB/Market. It doesn't taste bad but not good either. The typical maggie flavour is missing.Product has a manufacturing date of May, 2020 & 9 months to go till expiry.Looks totally original.Well packed 12 seperate packets of maggie instant noodles.To buy or not? Make a choice yourself.

  Firstly,Packets are much smaller in size. They are not the same as ""Rs12 packet""which are available in market.They are approx half of that packing.And secondly, there is no price mention on the packets.These packets are very small, worth value Rs6 per packet.Please dont buy from this seller.

  Add Carrot and tomatoes (Boil them for 8 Minutes) before adding it to Maggi Mix.- this will decrease the intense spiciness and make it soothing.- Will give a creme texture to the noodles - tastes awesome.- Improve your skin quality (Glowing and White Skin).  Good to health  - Better in taste.

  To be honest this particular maggie 2 mins noodles looks suspicious & tastes weired. Why so?Suspicious: The 2 mins instant noodles is like no other maggie noodles i are before. After 10 mins of soaking in hot water is still not soft enough. It stays skinny stiff & not properly soaked.Weired: It tastes different. Not like normal maggie I've eaten before, which were bought from BB/Market. It doesn't taste bad but not good either. The typical maggie flavour is missing.Product has a manufacturing date of May, 2020 & 9 months to go till expiry.Looks totally original.Well packed 12 seperate packets of maggie instant noodles.To buy or not? Make a choice yourself.

  To be honest this particular maggie 2 mins noodles looks suspicious & tastes weired. Why so?Suspicious: The 2 mins instant noodles is like no other maggie noodles i are before. After 10 mins of soaking in hot water is still not soft enough. It stays skinny stiff & not properly soaked.Weired: It tastes different. Not like normal maggie I've eaten before, which were bought from BB/Market. It doesn't taste bad but not good either. The typical maggie flavour is missing.Product has a manufacturing date of May, 2020 & 9 months to go till expiry.Looks totally original.Well packed 12 seperate packets of maggie instant noodles.To buy or not? Make a choice yourself.

  Firstly,Packets are much smaller in size. They are not the same as ""Rs12 packet""which are available in market.They are approx half of that packing.And secondly, there is no price mention on the packets.These packets are very small, worth value Rs6 per packet.Please dont buy from this seller.

  Add Carrot and tomatoes (Boil them for 8 Minutes) before adding it to Maggi Mix.- this will decrease the intense spiciness and make it soothing.- Will give a creme texture to the noodles - tastes awesome.- Improve your skin quality (Glowing and White Skin).  Good to health  - Better in taste.

  Add Carrot and tomatoes (Boil them for 8 Minutes) before adding it to Maggi Mix.- this will decrease the intense spiciness and make it soothing.- Will give a creme texture to the noodles - tastes awesome.- Improve your skin quality (Glowing and White Skin).  Good to health  - Better in taste.

  This particular Maggi Noodles variant does not taste or look good.Definitely not as good as Maggi Atta Noodles or Special Masala Maggi Noodles.I would avoid this , but would definitely opt for Maggi Atta Noodles any time.

  To be honest this particular maggie 2 mins noodles looks suspicious & tastes weired. Why so?Suspicious: The 2 mins instant noodles is like no other maggie noodles i are before. After 10 mins of soaking in hot water is still not soft enough. It stays skinny stiff & not properly soaked.Weired: It tastes different. Not like normal maggie I've eaten before, which were bought from BB/Market. It doesn't taste bad but not good either. The typical maggie flavour is missing.Product has a manufacturing date of May, 2020 & 9 months to go till expiry.Looks totally original.Well packed 12 seperate packets of maggie instant noodles.To buy or not? Make a choice yourself.

  Firstly,Packets are much smaller in size. They are not the same as ""Rs12 packet""which are available in market.They are approx half of that packing.And secondly, there is no price mention on the packets.These packets are very small, worth value Rs6 per packet.Please dont buy from this seller.

  Add Carrot and tomatoes (Boil them for 8 Minutes) before adding it to Maggi Mix.- this will decrease the intense spiciness and make it soothing.- Will give a creme texture to the noodles - tastes awesome.- Improve your skin quality (Glowing and White Skin).  Good to health  - Better in taste.

  To be honest this particular maggie 2 mins noodles looks suspicious & tastes weired. Why so?Suspicious: The 2 mins instant noodles is like no other maggie noodles i are before. After 10 mins of soaking in hot water is still not soft enough. It stays skinny stiff & not properly soaked.Weired: It tastes different. Not like normal maggie I've eaten before, which were bought from BB/Market. It doesn't taste bad but not good either. The typical maggie flavour is missing.Product has a manufacturing date of May, 2020 & 9 months to go till expiry.Looks totally original.Well packed 12 seperate packets of maggie instant noodles.To buy or not? Make a choice yourself.
